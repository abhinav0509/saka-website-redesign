                                <p>
								    Besides franchisees, in the year 2013 requirements came in from university colleges to provide a short term courses to their students in their own premise. With a new brand of CCA was launched called CCA @ colleges. Today in the year 2015 we are tied up with almost 25 ”A” grade colleges in Pune.

                                <p>								
                                   COLLEGE OF COMPUTER ACCOUNTANTS (Pune) is a major Accounts education, service and research Institute. CCA started its operations as a Computerized Finance Accounting, Taxation, Banking , Payroll, Training & Placement center.  We understand the requirement of the individuals to establish in this competitive professional atmosphere. Companies are looking for Accountants with a passion and drive for better performance.
								 </p>
                                 <p> 								 
									With reference to the above subject, CCA would like to conduct the CCA Courses in  college premises during the college hours for all Under graduate & post graduate students. Many  University's in Maharashtra added Tally Or Excel course in their Syllabus.
								</p>

								   With the help of the academic course this training would enhance the accounting skill as well as Excel knowledge. Ultimately helping the aspirants to be the deserving candidate for their organization and qualify for the interview.
