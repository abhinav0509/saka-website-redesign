                                <p> Every parent wants the very best for their children. In pursuit of that goal, parents make enormous sacrifices and go to great lengths. 
									If asked to explain what is  “ the very best”, most parents would say: “We want to give the very best education”.</p>
								<h3><p>What is the Midbrain ?</p></h3>
								<p>	The Mid Brain, is believed to ‘act’ as a bridge between our Left and Right Brain. Having an active Mid Brain, we believe, will ‘widen’ the channel of communication between the left and right brain resulting in a more balanced use of ‘Whole Brain’.</p>
								<p><b>How Do You “Activate” The Mid Brain?</b>Children at birth and up to the age of about 6 years, the mid brain is active. Beyond the age of 6, the mid brain development slows down and gradually become less active</p>
								<img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>style/images/mb.jpg" style="height:50%;width:60%; margin-left:10%;">
								<p>So, how do you awake the mid brain again?</p>
								<p>One of the most effective ways to activate the mid brain is to use sound waves. , a special set of sound waves to help with the activation of the middle brain.</p>
								<p>Through play and fun, your kids’ brain will be more relaxed, and feel more secured with the environment they are in. Under this excellence state, they response better to our proprietary sound wave.</p>
								<p>The process of “activating” the midbrain allows us to use our brain more efficiently, hence the improvement in cognitive abilities.</p>
								<p>Another interesting effect of midbrain activation that it allows children to sense the visual properties of objects without actually seeing them with their eyes (blindfolded).</p>
								<p><h3>Blindfold Reading</h3></p>
								<img src="images/br.png" alt=""style="height:200px;width:66%; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:18%;">
								<p>Using a simple series of steps: meditation, breathing and imaging; the right brain is progressively activated. Once children are able to form and hold steady images, they begin to flip rapidly through books.BFR is one of the child’s natural talents or abilities. This is done by rapidly flipping through the pages of a book. No emphasis is placed on reading the written word. The vibrations coming from the book are perceived and converted into colors and then images. The images can be seen and the content instantly understood. It is like the analogy of the blind man and the elephant. A sighted man can instantly see and know that it is an elephant before him. A blind man must painstakingly feel, smell and sense to reach the same conclusion.</p>
